Luke's Atomspace Bootstrap Guide
=============================================================

I wrote... more truthfully I should say, I am writing this quick start guide for people coming to the Atomspace cold, without the context and background to make sense of the documentation that is available elsewhere on the OpenCog wiki and GitHub repositories.
My intention is to clear up some of the the questions and misunderstandings that gave me trouble at first, and map out a path for getting up to speed reasonably quickly.

The Atomspace examples on Github are already designed to be an introduction.  They can be found here: `<https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/tree/master/examples/atomspace>`_
Personally, I felt like the examples alone were not able to answer many of my questions, either because they assumed some prior knowledge or vocabulary I didn't have or because the ordering of topics didn't fit with the way I was able to grok the information.
Therefore, I am attempting to fill in the gaps where I got hung up.

This guide certainly duplicates many concepts that are also covered in the examples, because I also wanted the guide to be able to stand alone.
That said, I tried to focus the guide on the places where I felt the examples missed something important, or waited too long to introduce a critical concept.

Perhaps you will find this guide to be complimentary to the examples, and progressing through both in parallel might be the best approach.

Let's begin.
